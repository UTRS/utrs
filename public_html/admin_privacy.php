<center><b>Unblock Ticket Request System Privacy Policy</b></center>
<p>Welcome to the Unblock Ticket Request System. We recognize that you are a volunteer administrator working to contribute
towards the world's largest free online encyclopedia. As such, we recognize that there may be some information
you'd rather keep private. We value that privacy and wish to assure you that we have taken steps to ensure
that by responding to unblock requests here, you are not at risk of exposing your identity on the internet. At the
same time, however, in order to ensure proper access, functionality and utilization of UTRS, we do need to collect certain
information that will assist us with those tasks.</p>

<h4>Wikimedia Labs Disclaimer</h4>
<p>By using this project, you agree that any private information you give to this project may be made publicly available and not be treated as confidential.

<p>By using this project, you agree that the volunteer administrators of this project will have access to any data you submit. This can include your IP address, your username/password combination for accounts created in Labs services, and any other information that you send. The volunteer administrators of this project are bound by the Wikimedia Labs Terms of Use, and are not allowed to share this information or use it in any non-approved way.

<p>Since access to this information is fundamental to the operation of Wikimedia Labs, these terms regarding use of your data expressly override the Wikimedia Foundation's Privacy Policy as it relates to the use and access of your personal information.


<h4>What data do we collect, and why?</h4>

<p>This system records your IP Address and useragent data.  This information may be processed overseas and your
data will remain confidential.
It is important to note that this information is provided by your internet browser to any website 
you visit; it is not possible to confirm any specific person's identity with this information. We only
use this to prevent abuse of Wikipedia and UTRS and to ensure the proper functionality of UTRS.</p>

<p>We also require your email address so that we can notify you about important information relevant to you.</p>

<p>By creating an account at UTRS, you agree to provide this information and allow UTRS Developers and WMF Labs System Administrators 
to view it for the explicit purpose of maintaining the integrity and operation of the tool.</p>

<h4>How is this data stored, and who can see it?</h4>

<p>We store this data in a secure database, which is visible only to UTRS developers, all of whom
are identified to the Wikimedia Foundation, just as Checkusers and Oversighters are required to do. In order to assist 
with reviewing your block, this information is provided to UTRS volunteers as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your email address will be only to you and UTRS Developers and WMF Labs System Administrator</li>
<li>Your useragent and IP address will only be visible to UTRS developers and WMF Labs System Administrators.</li>
<li>Your useragent and IP address addtionally be visible upon request from an approved member of the Wikimedia Foundation.
The use of this is rare, logged and monitered. You agree that any data released under this is subject to the Privacy Policy 
of the Wikimedia Foundation, and this privacy policy is nullified for the released data only.</li>
</ul>
<p>At no point will your data be provided to a third party for any purpose; furthermore, any private and sensitive data
regarding your account is removed after three months of it being in the tool. This 
removal process is automated, so you don't need to worry about anyone forgetting to hit the "delete" button.</p>
<p>Finally, we are not the Wikimedia Foundation.  We are a group of volunteers who have made our identities
known to the foundation.</p>
